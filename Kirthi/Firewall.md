### <center>FIREWALL AND HOW IT IS BEING USED IN RCC?</center>

<p>If your system is connected to the internet, you are a potential target for cyber threats. That is, when you shop online or you use internet banking, you are vulnerable to cyber threats by hackers. Firewall acts as a barrier between your system and the cyber space. Whenever you are connected to the internet, you are sharing and receiving the information by the use of small units called packets. Firewall clearly examines these packets and ignores them if there are any threats. Thus, protects us from hackers who may steal our confidential information such as account number, password, etc.</p>

<u>**What is Firewall?**</u>

<p>Firewall is a network security device that protects our system from different kinds of security threats. It monitors the incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. A Firewall may be hardware or software or both.</p>
