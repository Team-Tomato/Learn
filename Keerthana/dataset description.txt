4. day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100

13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84
(this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
sense to model with the logarithm transform).
